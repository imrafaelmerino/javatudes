# Introducci√≥n

I love programming and dedicate time to refine my skills regularly. As part of my learning journey, I choose captivating
problems and algorithms to solve independently, without relying on external libraries. My focus is on Java, and I enjoy
the challenge of implementing solutions from scratch. This hands-on approach not only deepens my understanding of the
programming language but also hones my problem-solving skills. It's a gratifying process that allows me to explore and
apply concepts, fostering a stronger foundation in both programming and algorithmic thinking.

# Javatudes

A collection of Java-based projects demonstrating various algorithmic and puzzle-solving concepts.

# Puzzle Implementations

1. **[Four Colour Map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem):** Solving the historic Four Color Map Problem,
   a classic conundrum in graph theory and
   cartography. Notably, this problem was first conquered
   using [artificial intelligence techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem#Proof) by mathematicians
   Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken in 1976. The solution involved an exhaustive computer search, marking a pioneering
   application of AI in mathematical problem-solving.
2. **[8 Sliding Puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle):** Implementation of the classic 8-puzzle game.
3. **[15 Sliding Puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle):** A variation using walking distance heuristic
   from [Kenichiro Takahashi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle).
4. **[Bloxorz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloxorz):** A puzzle game involving a rectangular block that must fall into
   a square hole.
5. **[Bridge And Torch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_and_torch_problem):** Solving the classic bridge and torch
   problem.
6. **[Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life):** Implementing Conway's Game of Life
   simulation.
7. **[Missionaries and Cannibals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missionaries_and_cannibals):** Solving the missionaries
   and cannibals river crossing problem.
8. **[Sudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku_solving_algorithms):** Implementation of a Sudoku solver.
9. **Water Pouring Problem:** Solving a problem related to pouring water between jugs to measure a specific quantity.
10. **[Zebra Puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebra_Puzzle):** The Zebra Puzzle, also known as Einstein's Riddle,
    is a classic logic puzzle that involves
    deducing the characteristics of a set of houses and their occupants. The puzzle provides a set of clues, each
    offering information about the relationships between the houses and the people living in them. The challenge is to
    use deductive reasoning to solve the puzzle and determine the specific attributes of each house and occupant.
11. **[Task Scheduling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_scheduling):** Implementing algorithms for task scheduling.
12. **[Wold Goat And Cabbage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf,_goat,_and_cabbage_problem):** Solving the classic
    river-crossing puzzle with a wolf, goat, and cabbage.
13. **[Zebra Puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebra_Puzzle):** Another implementation of the Zebra Puzzle.

## Algorithms Developed

1. **[Depth First Search (DFS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search):** A graph traversal algorithm.
2. **[Breath First Search (BFS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search):** Another graph traversal
   algorithm.
3. **[Branch and Bound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_and_bound):** An algorithm for finding the optimal solution
   to combinatorial problems.
4. **[A Star (A*)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm):** A popular pathfinding algorithm combining
   greedy and Dijkstra's approaches.
5. **[Floyd and Warshall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Warshall_algorithm):** Algorithms for finding
   shortest paths in a weighted graph.
6. **[CSP (Constraint Satisfaction Problem)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction_problem):**
   Implementing various techniques such as backtracking and forward checking
   for solving CSPs.
